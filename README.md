<!-- FAQs -->
## FAQs
 * Can I go in-game?
   * Yes with Carbon on most past versions upto version 30.00 of fortnite, however with the latest version of fortnite(30.10+) Epic Games added new protections to stop you from launching
   directly with the shipping exe and only lobby is supported through a proxy method, check it out [here](https://discord.com/invite/X525zyJtaU).
 * Will I get banned?
   * No, you won't get banned because Neonite V2 doesn't connect to any Epic Games related services.
 * How do I play with my friends?
   * Neonite V2 is a locally-hosted project, meaning it has no party or friends functionality.
 * Why don't I see any cosmetics in my locker?
   * We removed cosmetics because Epic Games made it clear it does not like services that offer cosmetics for free. If you wish for skins you're welcome to add them yourself.
